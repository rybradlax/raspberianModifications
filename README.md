# raspberianModifications
0.0.1
This is a github that uses the open source features of Raspberian in order to improve user experience! Hoping to build my own Linux soon too, Blados!
In order to use the basic modifications (only ones implemented as of now,) download this git with the "git" command on Raspberian (Debian Linux,)  to make your user/passw use the open.py file, and then try crontabbing or running the start.sh for us to protect your sudo.
This as of now is an alternative to sudo -k, and doesn't even change the sources for Raspberian, but it is made to protect root commands.
I am aware of an error in start.sh for the username/password input, hoping to fix soon!
Enjoy!

0.0.2
Recently added a Calculator module for python to this project, isn't of importance to Raspberian, but a fun side project that will likely be made into something pertaining to this project, compatible with all Python versions 3+.
In order to run it, just run the script and do "from module import Calc" as anything you want, then use it!
(I will start project wiki soon too by the way)
