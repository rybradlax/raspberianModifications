This is a file wiper for python in version 0.0.1, this permanently removes files on Linux and windows. 
This command is similar to the sudo rm <file> command on Linux, and is ran root (sudo.) For Windows usage run the Windows file. In addition, this has an autoremover, simply just change "file" to a file that does not have quotations, there are no quotations to begin with so it shouldn't be a problem, it will remove files the x amount of time set by the user when ran.
